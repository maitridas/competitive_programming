Set always inserts the elements in a sorted order.

This will be default be sorted in increasing order or ascending order.

If want to sort in decreasing order

end points to the element beyonf=d the last element

Set ignores duplicate values

Find returns iterator to the element if present else returns end iterator.

clear removes all element s.clear()

s.count(<element>) returns 1 if exist else 0 though count always returns the frequency but in case of set as only unique elements are there so it returns 1.

s.erase(<element>) removes a element
Also takes iterator
s.erase(<iterator>)
s.erase(it,s.end()) -> removes all element between it and s.end() excluding s.end()

Lower bound method -
- if elem present returns the iterator to it
- else if not present and is smaller than the largest element in the set returns iterator to the element just greater than the passed element
- else returns end if the element is greater than the greatest element.

Upper bound method -
- if elem present returns the iterator to it next to the elem
- else if not present and is smaller than the largest element in the set returns iterator to the element just greater than the passed element
- else returns end if the element is greater than the greatest element.

Set is built on top of self belancing binary tree known as Red Black tree

Iterators in set are bidirectional that is we can do it++ or it-- but these are not random access iterators so we can't do it+5 and all

## Ceiling on right

Given an array, we need to find ceiling of every element on right side of it.

### Naive

traverse the array n^2

### Efficient Solution : O(nlogn), Space: O(n)

## Multiset

Set allows only one instance multiset allows multiple instances.

![](./images/set/img22.JPG)

erase remains all instances of the value other forms are same as set

count returns frequency.
