# Tree Data Structure

Tree Data Structure is used to organise data in hierarchical manner.
In this video we discuss about:
node,root,leaf,child,parent,subtree,descendants,ancestors,degree and internal nodes.

tree stores in hirarchial

tree are reccursive with subtree

descendent are the leaf nodes under a parent/root node

tree nodes which have degree 0 are leaf nodes and all other are internal nodes.

## Binary Tree

In Binary Tree every node has at most two children.

## Tree Traversal

Tree Traversal is basically going through every node(key) exactly once.

Types of Tree Traversal i.e. Breadth-First Search(BFS) and Depth First Search(DFS).

Inorder, preorder and postorder traversals they are permutations of DFS , as we can visit subtrees in any order.

## Implementation of Inorder Traversal

Implementation of Inorder Traversal
In this video, we discuss a function that takes root as a parameter, whose return type is void and is supposed to print inorder traversal of the Tree whose nodes are given.

## Implementation of Preorder Traversal

Implementation of Preorder Traversal
In this video, we discuss a function that takes root as a parameter, whose return type is void and is supposed to print Preorder traversal of the Tree whose nodes are given.

same as inorder

## Implementation of Postorder Traversal

Implementation of Postorder Traversal
In this video, we discuss a function that takes root as a parameter, whose return type is void and is supposed to print Postorder traversal of the Tree whose nodes are given.

same as above two

## Height of Binary Tree

Height of Binary Tree is the number of nodes between the longest path from root to leaf node(including the root and leaf node).
In this video we discuss about a recursive function that takes root of the tree and returns the height of the Binary Tree.

## Print Nodes at K distance

Nodes at distance k from the root are basically the nodes at (k+1)th level of the Binary Tree.
In this video, we discuss a function that takes root and k as a parameter, whose return type is void and is supposed to print the nodes at distance k from the root.

time complexity : O(n)

Auxillary space : O(h)

h: height of binary tree

## Level Order Traversal

Level order traversal of a tree is breadth first traversal of binary tree.
In this video we will discuss about a function that takes root as a parameter, doesnâ€™t returns anything and prints the level order traversal in a single line.we implement this function using queue datastructure.

We will use queue data structure here recursion is not a good idea
